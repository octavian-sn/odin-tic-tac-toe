# odin-tic-tac-toe
Project: Tic-Tac-Toe from TheOdinProject curriculum

The goal of the project was to have as little global code as possible, and in order to achieve this, we had make use of factory functions and modules.

The main challenge for me, was to initially understand the purpose of modals and then, make use of them correctly, even if you understand scope and closure, you don't really know them until you do stuff and you see why exactly isn't or how it's working. 
After a lot of researching and documenting, and *reiterating* I eventually managed to wrap my head around it all and place every element inside it's corresponding recipient to make it all work.

Quite challenging and bothersome, but you can really understand the whole purpose of it when thinking about *spaghetti code* and major projects with massive amounts of code.

Thank you TOP for not going easy on us!

*There is an optional task to create an AI to play against, which I intend to tackle and will update readme upon doing so.
